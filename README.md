# 555 Timer Logic Clock System

This project demonstrates a control logic system using all three modes of the 555 timer IC — astable, monostable, and bistable — integrated in a single circuit, along with basic logic gates to simulate CPU-like clock management.

## Features
- **Astable Mode**: Generates continuous clock signal with speed control via potentiometer.
- **Monostable Mode**: Manual clock pulse generation (one-shot).
- **Bistable Configuration**: Slide switch to toggle between auto and manual modes.
- **HLT (Halt) Logic**: When driven HIGH, the system halts execution (clock disable), replicating CPU halt control.
- **Logic Gates Used**: AND, OR, NOT gates simulate basic control logic.
- **Powered by**: 5V regulator circuit (since Tinkercad lacks 5V battery source).
- **Built on**: Tinkercad Simulator
